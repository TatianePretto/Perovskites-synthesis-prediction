# Perovskites-synthesis-prediction

Synthesis prediction of double perovskites based on the hot injection method.

Abstract: we recently introduced flux-regulated crystallization (FRC), a method that dynamically monitors and adjusts crystal growth from solutions in real time using computer vision and feedback control. Using FRC, we synthesized centimeter-scale perovskite single crystals at a stable linear growth rate of 0.2 mm h-1 with a standard deviation (σ) of 0.061 mm h-1. Here we integrate machine learning into FRC to predict solvent evaporation rates, leading to a fourfold decrease in σ to 0.015 mm h-1. This further improves reproducibility of perovskite crystallinity, as evidenced by average full width at half maximum of 20 ± 2 arcsec in X-ray rocking curve measurements; and of perovskite X-ray detectors, as evidenced by an average sensitivity of 4,500 ± 500 μC Gyair-1 cm-2 at an electric field of 100 V cm-1 across 13 devices..


All machine learning models, as well as plots (including SHAP values, parity plots, and residual plots), are presented in the code file 'ML Perovskite Paper Code.' This includes optimization of the models using both tested functions.
